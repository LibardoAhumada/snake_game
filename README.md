**Game Description: Snake Game**

Welcome to the classic Snake Game! The objective is simple: control the snake using the arrow keys to guide it in the desired direction. The challenge lies in making the snake reach and "eat" the food, represented by a colored square on the board.

**How to Win:**

Win by accumulating points each time the snake "eats" the food. Each time the snake consumes a food square, its length increases, and your score goes up. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible. Good luck!

**How to Lose:**

Be cautious not to touch the walls of the board or collide with the snake's own tail. Any of these actions will result in the end of the game. Remember, as the snake grows, it becomes more challenging to control, so plan your moves carefully.

Have fun challenging yourself and beating your records in this classic Snake Game!
